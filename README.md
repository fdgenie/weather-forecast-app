# WeatherApp

This project is a single page application that shows basic information about the weather of five cities. The api I used for the data is http://openweathermap.org/current.
The project consists of three components. The first component is the weather-card which is the container for the other two and also forms the shape of the card. The second component is the weather-front-card where we can see the basic information of a city's current weather. The last component is the weather-back-card where we can see the forecast of the next seven hours of a city. The application is responsive.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
